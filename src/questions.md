Here are some practice questions that can help you code and work with a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA):

### 1. **Basic DFA Construction**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that end with the substring `ab`.
- **Hint:** The DFA should transition between states based on whether the string has recently seen an `a` followed by a `b`.

### 2. **DFA for Even Number of Zeros**

- **Question:** Construct a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{0, 1}` where the number of `0`s in the string is even.
- **Hint:** You will need two states: one for an even number of `0`s and one for an odd number of `0`s. The DFA should alternate between these two states as it processes each `0`.

### 3. **DFA for Binary Numbers Divisible by 3**

- **Question:** Build a DFA that accepts binary strings (composed of `0`s and `1`s) that represent numbers divisible by 3.
- **Hint:** You need to keep track of the remainder when the binary number is divided by 3, which will require at least 3 states to handle remainders 0, 1, and 2.

### 4. **DFA for Palindrome Strings**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts palindromes over the alphabet `{a, b}`. (Note: This is a trick question â€” no DFA can accept all palindromes!)
- **Hint:** Consider the limitations of DFA when processing palindromes.

### 5. **DFA for Strings Containing Substring `ab`**

- **Question:** Create a DFA that accepts all strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that contain the substring `ab` at least once.
- **Hint:** The DFA must transition through states based on whether it has seen `a` followed by `b`.

### 6. **DFA for Strings with an Odd Length**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that have an odd length.
- **Hint:** The DFA needs two states, one representing an odd-length string and the other representing an even-length string.

### 7. **DFA for Strings That Do Not Contain `aa`**

- **Question:** Construct a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that do not contain the substring `aa`.
- **Hint:** The DFA must transition when `a` is seen, checking if another `a` follows.

### 8. **DFA for Strings with an Even Number of `1`s**

- **Question:** Build a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{0, 1}` where the number of `1`s in the string is even.
- **Hint:** Use two states, one representing an even number of `1`s and the other representing an odd number of `1`s.

### 9. **DFA for Strings Containing Only Vowels**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, e, i, o, u}` that only contain vowels.
- **Hint:** The DFA must reject any string that contains a character other than a vowel.

### 10. **DFA for Strings with Exactly One `a`**

- **Question:** Create a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that contain exactly one `a`.
- **Hint:** The DFA should accept strings that contain exactly one `a` and any number of `b`s.

### 11. **DFA for Binary Strings with No Consecutive `1`s**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts binary strings (composed of `0`s and `1`s) that do not contain consecutive `1`s.
- **Hint:** The DFA should transition based on whether the last character was `1` or `0`.

### 12. **DFA for Strings Ending with `abc`**

- **Question:** Construct a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b, c}` that end with the substring `abc`.
- **Hint:** The DFA should transition between states as it processes the input and should accept when it ends in `abc`.

### 13. **DFA for Strings with Odd Number of `a`s and Even Number of `b`s**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that have an odd number of `a`s and an even number of `b`s.
- **Hint:** You'll need a combination of states to track both the number of `a`s and the number of `b`s.

### 14. **DFA for Strings That Start with `a`**

- **Question:** Construct a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{a, b}` that start with the letter `a`.
- **Hint:** The DFA should have an initial state that accepts `a` and transitions for the rest of the string.

### 15. **DFA for Strings That Do Not Contain `a` or `b`**

- **Question:** Write a DFA that accepts strings over the alphabet `{c, d}` and does not contain any occurrences of `a` or `b`.
- **Hint:** The DFA should only accept strings composed of `c` and `d`.

These questions will give you a good range of scenarios to practice DFA design and implementation, helping you understand the intricacies of how DFAs process strings.
